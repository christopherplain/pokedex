# Pokedex CLI

The Pokedex CLI is a Go CLI project that implements a very basic Pokedex as a learning exercise. Data for the Pokedex is fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

## Requirements

The app requires Go. All development and testing was done using Go `1.21`. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

## Running the App

Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory to launch the app:

```shell
% go build && ./pokedex
```

Type "help" to get a list of commands:

```shell
Pokedex > help
```

Exit the app by type "exit".

```shell
Pokedex > exit
```

## Boot.dev

The Pokedex CLI is a learning exercise I created while working through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) coursework. Boot.dev is a great resource for learning backend development. Please check out their courses if you're interested in learning to build similar projects.
